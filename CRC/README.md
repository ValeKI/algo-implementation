# CRC (Sender Side CRC)
[Cyclic Redundancy Check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check)
A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data. Blocks of data entering these systems get a short check value attached, based on the remainder of a polynomial division of their contents. On retrieval, the calculation is repeated and, in the event the check values do not match, corrective action can be taken against data corruption. CRCs can be used for error correction 

## Getting Started
Just clone the CRC repository and open this project in your JAVA IDE. You have to provide the input.txt file and put whatever message you want to transfer using CRC.It will generate crcOutput.txt file which contains the message to be transmitted.

## Prerequisites
1. You should have JAVA IDE.
